Impact of observation error on the performance of a simple harvest control rule
Charlie Edwards and Finlay Scott

Outline
-------

Conditioning of stock
----------------------
Start with the stock at unfished state (B = k)
Fish for 10 years at some predetermined level. Probably quite high so that the
stock is near equilibrium and B is about 20% of k.
Possible to include noise on the stock recruitment relationship.

1. Check that the HCR works
---------------------------

Assume perfect knowledge, i.e. observation error = 0.
Also turn off SRR noise
Set Blim = 0
Project forward 20 years and try to manage stock
Within each year:
  Project 'true' stock forward using TAC set by HCR
  Update perceived index and catch data (ageless) with no obs error
  Perform assessment
  Pass estimated parameters to the HCR function
  Get TAC for next year
Does the HCR get us to MSY?

2. Investigate the impact of observation error
----------------------------------------------
Similar to (1) except that now we use observation error when constructing
the perceived catch and index data.
Do we use SRR noise? Maybe for the final simulations

Performance statistics
----------------------
Total yield
Net Present Value
Probability of stock collapse
Probability of reaching MSY within x years
